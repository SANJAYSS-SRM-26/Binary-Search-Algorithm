# Binary-Search-Algorithm
This repository contains a simple C program implementing the binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements in each iteration.

# Contents:
Binarysearch.c: Contains the C code for the binary search algorithm.
README.md: Provides an overview of the binary search algorithm and instructions on how to use the program.

# How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the binary_search.c file using any C compiler (e.g., gcc).
Run the compiled executable.
The program will prompt you to enter the element you want to search for.
It will then display whether the element is present in the array and its index if it exists.

# Feel free to contribute improvements or report any issues in the code. Happy coding!
