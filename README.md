# Binary-Search-Algorithm
This repository contains a simple C program implementing the binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements in each iteration.
